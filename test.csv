     Synthesis with Incomplete Informatio ,"    Orna Kupferman, Moshe Y. Vardi",,"            <span id=""ctl00_MainContent_PaperItem_snippet"">In program synthesis, we transform a specication into a system that is guar- anteed to satisfy the specication. When the system is open, then at each moment it reads input signals and writes output signals, which depend on the input signals and the history of the computation so far. The specication considers all possible input sequences. Thus, if the specication is linear, it should hold in every computation generated by the interaction, and if the specication is branching, it should hold in the tree that embodies all possible input sequences. Often, the system cannot read all the input signals generated by its environment. For example, in a distributed setting, it might be that each process can read input signals of only part of the underlying processes. Then, we should transform a specication into a sys- tem whose output depends only on the readable parts of the input signals and the history of the computation. This is called synthesis with incomplete information. In this work we solve the problem of synthesis with <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/19412/incomplete-information'>incomplete information</a>  in its full generality. We consider linear and branching settings with complete and incomplete information. We claim that alternation is a suitable and helpful mechanism for coping with incomplete information. Using alternating tree automata, we show that <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/19412/incomplete-information'>incomplete information</a>  does not make the synthesis problem more complex, in both the linear and the branching paradigm. In partic- ular, we prove that independently of the presence of incomplete information, the synthesis problems for CTL and CTL? are complete for EXPTIME and 2EXPTIME, respectively.

     Algorithm Synthesis by Lazy Thinking Examples and Implementation in Theorema ,    Adrian Cr,,"            <span id=""ctl00_MainContent_PaperItem_snippet"">Recently, we proposed a systematic method for top-down synthesis and veriflcation of lemmata and algorithms called ""lazy thinking method"" as a part of systematic mathematical theory exploration (mathematical knowledge management). The lazy thinking method is characterized: † by using a library of theorem and algorithm schemes † and by using the information contained in failing attempts to prove the schematic theorem or the correctness theorem for the algorithm scheme for inventing lem- mata or requirements for subalgorithms, respectively. In this paper, we give a couple of examples for algorithm synthesis using the lazy thinking paradigm. These examples illustrate how the synthesized algorithm de- pends on the algorithm scheme used. Also, we give details about the implementa- tion of the lazy thinking algorithm synthesis method in the frame of the Theorema system. In this implementation, the synthesis of the example algorithms can be carried out completely automatically, i.e. without any user interaction.

An Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) with members from Chevron, Eastman Chemical, Energy International, Teir Associates, and the <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/52048/department-of-defense'>Department of Defense</a>  has been formed to provide practical guidance to the program. The program has two principal objectives. (1) Develop technology for conversion of C1 source materials (natural gas, synthesis gas, <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/4735/carbon-dioxide'>carbon dioxide</a>  and monoxide, and methanol) into clean, <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/18074/high-efficiency'>high efficiency</a>  transportation fuel. (2) Develop novel processes for producing hydrogen from <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/27118/natural-gas'>natural gas</a>  and other hydrocarbons. Some of the principal accomplishments of the program in its first two years are: (1) The addition of acetylenic compounds in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is found to produce significant amounts of oxygenated products in FT diesel fuels. Such oxygenated products should decrease <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/30289/particulate-matter'>particulate matter</a>  (PM) emissions. (2) Nanoscale, binary, Fe-based catalysts supported on alumina have been shown to have significant activity for the decomposition of <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/25079/methane'>methane</a>  into pure hydrogen and potentially valuable multi-walled carbon nanotubes. (3) Catalytic synthesis processes have been developed for synthesis of diethyl carbonate, higher ethers, and higher alcohols from C1 source materials. Testing of the effect of adding these oxygenates to <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/51590/diesel-fuel'>diesel fuel</a>  on PM emissions has begun using a well-equipped small <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/9801/diesel-engine'>diesel engine</a>  test facility. (4) <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/40736/supercritical-fluid'>Supercritical fluid</a>  (SCF) FT synthesis has been conducted under SCF hexane using both Fe and Co catalysts.

     Complexity Issues in Automated Addition of Time-Bounded Liveness Properties1 ,"    Borzoo Bonakdarpour, Sandeep S.

Time-bounded liveness (also called time-bounded response) ñ that something good will happen soon, in a certain amount of time ñ captures a wide range of requirements for specifying real-time and embedded systems. We show that the problem of automatic ad- dition of a time-bounded liveness property to a given <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/70843/timed-automaton'>timed automaton</a>  while maintaining maximal nondeterminism is NP-hard in the size of locations of the input automaton. Fur- thermore, we show that by relaxing the maximality requirement we can devise a sound and complete algorithm that adds a time-bounded liveness property to a given timed automaton, while preserving its existing MTL specication. This synthesis method is useful in adding properties that are later discovered as a crucial part of a program. Moreover, we show that addition of interval time-bounded liveness, where the good thing should not happen sooner than a certain amount of time, is also NP-hard in the size of locations even without maximal nondeterminism. Finally, we show that adding time-bounded and interval time-bounded as well as unbounded liveness properties are all PSPACE-complete in the size of the input timed automaton.

The flagellar ct-tubulin <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/15897/gene-family'>gene family</a>  is represented in the genome by about eight homologous DNA segments that are exceptionally similar and yet are neither iden- tical nor arrayed in a short tandem repeat. The coding regions of three of these genes have been sequenced, two from cDNA clones and one from an intronless genomic gene. These three genes encode an identical a-tubulin that is conserved relative to the ~t-tubulins of other organisms except at the carboxyl terminus, where the protein is elongated by two residues and ends in a terminal glutamine instead of the canonical tyrosine. In spite of the protein conservation, the Naegleria <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/10795/dna-sequence'>DNA sequence</a>  has diverged markedly from the a-tubulin genes of other organisms, a counterex- ample to the idea that tubulin genes are conserved. ct-Tubulin mRNA homologous to this <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/15897/gene-family'>gene family</a>  has not been detected in amebae. This mRNA in- creases markedly in abundance during the first hour of differentiation, and then decreases even more rapidly with a half-life of ""~8 min. The abundance of physical a-tubulin mRNA rises and subsequently falls in paral- lel with the abundance of translatable flagellar tubulin mRNA and with the in vivo rate of flagellar tubulin synthesis, which indicates that flagellar tubulin synthe- sis is directly regulated by the relative rates of tran- scription and mRNA degradation.

This paper shows how software partitioning may yield undesirable side-effects involving 'false' algebraic loops, which affects model execution and program synthesis. It presents an approach to resolve these pathological cases for a class of block diagram models.

     Synthesis with Incomplete Informatio ,"    Orna Kupferman, Moshe Y. Vardi",,"            <span id=""ctl00_MainContent_PaperItem_snippet"">In program synthesis, we transform a specication into a system that is guar- anteed to satisfy the specication. When the system is open, then at each moment it reads input signals and writes output signals, which depend on the input signals and the history of the computation so far. The specication considers all possible input sequences. Thus, if the specication is linear, it should hold in every computation generated by the interaction, and if the specication is branching, it should hold in the tree that embodies all possible input sequences. Often, the system cannot read all the input signals generated by its environment. For example, in a distributed setting, it might be that each process can read input signals of only part of the underlying processes. Then, we should transform a specication into a sys- tem whose output depends only on the readable parts of the input signals and the history of the computation. This is called synthesis with incomplete information. In this work we solve the problem of synthesis with <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/19412/incomplete-information'>incomplete information</a>  in its full generality. We consider linear and branching settings with complete and incomplete information. We claim that alternation is a suitable and helpful mechanism for coping with incomplete information. Using alternating tree automata, we show that <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/19412/incomplete-information'>incomplete information</a>  does not make the synthesis problem more complex, in both the linear and the branching paradigm. In partic- ular, we prove that independently of the presence of incomplete information, the synthesis problems for CTL and CTL? are complete for EXPTIME and 2EXPTIME, respectively.

     Algorithm Synthesis by Lazy Thinking Examples and Implementation in Theorema ,    Adrian Cr,,"            <span id=""ctl00_MainContent_PaperItem_snippet"">Recently, we proposed a systematic method for top-down synthesis and veriflcation of lemmata and algorithms called ""lazy thinking method"" as a part of systematic mathematical theory exploration (mathematical knowledge management). The lazy thinking method is characterized: † by using a library of theorem and algorithm schemes † and by using the information contained in failing attempts to prove the schematic theorem or the correctness theorem for the algorithm scheme for inventing lem- mata or requirements for subalgorithms, respectively. In this paper, we give a couple of examples for algorithm synthesis using the lazy thinking paradigm. These examples illustrate how the synthesized algorithm de- pends on the algorithm scheme used. Also, we give details about the implementa- tion of the lazy thinking algorithm synthesis method in the frame of the Theorema system. In this implementation, the synthesis of the example algorithms can be carried out completely automatically, i.e. without any user interaction.

     COOPERATIVE RESEARCH IN C1 CHEMISTRY ,    Gerald P. Huffman,,"            <span id=""ctl00_MainContent_PaperItem_snippet"">Faculty and students from five universities (Kentucky, West Virginia, Utah, Pittsburgh and Auburn) are collaborating on a <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/2993/basic-research'>basic research</a>  program to develop novel C1 chemistry processes for the production of clean, high quality transportation fuel. An Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) with members from Chevron, Eastman Chemical, Energy International, Teir Associates, and the <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/52048/department-of-defense'>Department of Defense</a>  has been formed to provide practical guidance to the program. The program has two principal objectives. (1) Develop technology for conversion of C1 source materials (natural gas, synthesis gas, <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/4735/carbon-dioxide'>carbon dioxide</a>  and monoxide, and methanol) into clean, <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/18074/high-efficiency'>high efficiency</a>  transportation fuel. (2) Develop novel processes for producing hydrogen from <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/27118/natural-gas'>natural gas</a>  and other hydrocarbons. Some of the principal accomplishments of the program in its first two years are: (1) The addition of acetylenic compounds in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is found to produce significant amounts of oxygenated products in FT diesel fuels. Such oxygenated products should decrease <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/30289/particulate-matter'>particulate matter</a>  (PM) emissions. (2) Nanoscale, binary, Fe-based catalysts supported on alumina have been shown to have significant activity for the decomposition of <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/25079/methane'>methane</a>  into pure hydrogen and potentially valuable multi-walled carbon nanotubes. (3) Catalytic synthesis processes have been developed for synthesis of diethyl carbonate, higher ethers, and higher alcohols from C1 source materials. Testing of the effect of adding these oxygenates to <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/51590/diesel-fuel'>diesel fuel</a>  on PM emissions has begun using a well-equipped small <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/9801/diesel-engine'>diesel engine</a>  test facility. (4) <a href='http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Keyword/40736/supercritical-fluid'>Supercritical fluid</a>  (SCF) FT synthesis has been conducted under SCF hexane using both Fe and Co catalysts. There is a marked effect on the hydrocarbon product distribution, with a shift to higher carbon number products. These and other results are summarized.
